Project 4 README
------------------------------

This program introduces the three scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCSFS), Priority, and Round Robin (RR). 

To start this:

1) Install and setup Virtual Box thats running a Linux distro (Ubuntu is suggested) for this project.

2) Make sure to locate the three scheduling files when you download them, and remember the pathfile so you can "cd" into it on the Ubuntu terminal.

3) Once you're in the project folder, you can create the executables by running this command in the terminal:

"make fcfs" -> Makes FCFS executable
"make priority" -> Makes Priority executable
"make rr" -> Makes RR executable

4) After creating the executables, you can run it with the following text files:

"./fcfs schedule.txt" 
"./priority schedule.txt"
"./rr schedule.txt"
